<h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>This website is an advertising site which is designed to allow the user to issue repair offers for a given car part. <br>
  The mechanics can review these offers and then accept one of them and commit to repair it. Both users and mechanics <br>
  can add offers, because we assume that some mechanics will want to order the repair of their parts to other mechanics <br>
  in case they can not fix the part</p>
